                    <h3>Edge Computing</h3>
                    <p>Unpredictable network disruptions, latency and bandwidth limitations can bring
                        lot of issues to traditional enterprise computing paradigm built around centralized
                        server architecture.
                       <br><br> Nova Vector Platform provides integrated Edge Computing solution
                        and management tools. We allow you to move some of the data processing out of
                        the data center, to the factory floor. Once deployed, Nova Edge enables you to
                        send only the results of that computing work at the edge , such as real-time
                        business insights, equipment maintenance predictions or other actionable answers,
                        back to the main data center for review and other human interactions.</p>
